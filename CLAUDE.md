## Phase 2 Completion Notes
All Phase 2 verification steps pass. Key implementation details for future reference:

### Schema additions (beyond original plan)
- `rooms.ceiling_height_cm integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 260` — added via migration, controls isometric wall height

### IsometricCanvas (src/components/editor/IsometricCanvas.tsx)
- PixiJS 8 async init with race condition fix: room/materials stored in refs so init callback can draw immediately
- Always mounted by parent (EditorPage) only when selectedRoom is non-null — never mounts with null room
- 2:1 isometric projection: Width axis (+T, -T/2) per metre, Depth axis (-T, -T/2) per metre, T=64px/m
- Wall height: `Math.round((ceiling_height_cm / 100) * T * 0.6)` — fully dynamic from room data
- Renders: N visible walls (back-to-front sorted), N-vertex floor polygon, doors/windows from geometry, lighting fixture (glow + dot at centroid)
- Door/window placement: click-to-place on visible walls. Stored in `room.geometry.doors[]` / `room.geometry.windows[]` with `wall_index` (segment index into vertices) and position (0-1). Legacy `PhysicalWall` field migrated via `migrateFixtureWallIndex()` in roomGeometry.ts.

### finish_materials table
- All 32 preset materials have hex colors in thumbnail_path (wall: already hex; floor/door/window/lighting: updated from preset:xxx keys)
- Canvas reads finish color via getFinishColor() for all 5 types

### UIStore sidebar tabs
- SidebarTab type: 'rooms' | 'finishes' | 'catalog' | 'templates'

## Phase 3 Completion Notes
Full AI pipeline verified end-to-end. Key implementation details:

### Supabase Client Concurrency
The Supabase JS client hangs when multiple operations run concurrently through the same instance (DB queries, auth calls, function invocations). Workarounds used throughout Phase 3:
- **`invokeEdgeFunction` helper** (`useCatalogStore.ts`): Uses raw `fetch` + localStorage auth token instead of `supabase.functions.invoke`. Also returns parsed response `data` (used to get `glb_path` from `generate-3d-model`).
- **Local Zustand `set()` instead of DB writes** for status updates where the DB already has the correct state (e.g. `triggerBackgroundRemoval`, `approveImage`, `rejectImage`).
- **Sequential flow in `handleSaveVariants`** (`AddFurnitureModal.tsx`): Create variants → load variants → close modal → THEN trigger background removal. No concurrent Supabase operations.
- **`navigator.locks` bypass** in `src/lib/supabase.ts`: `lock` option set to immediately execute the callback.
- **Never reload variants from DB when edge function response contains needed data** (e.g. `glb_path` comes from `generate-3d-model` response, not from re-querying DB).

### Client-Side Sprite Rendering
- `src/lib/renderSprites.ts` — Downloads .glb from `glb-models` bucket, renders 4 isometric angles (512x512, OrthographicCamera, 35.264° elevation) on offscreen canvas using Three.js, uploads PNGs to `sprites` bucket, upserts `furniture_sprites` rows.
- Replaces the deprecated `render-sprites` Edge Function (which failed because `npm:canvas` needs native binaries unavailable in Deno).
- Triggered from `approveImage` in `useCatalogStore.ts` after `generate-3d-model` returns.

### Edge Functions
- `scrape-product` — Shopee API + IKEA HTML + generic JSON-LD fallback
- `remove-background` — Replicate `cjwbw/rembg`, polls for completion, uploads to `clean-images` bucket
- `generate-3d-model` — Replicate TRELLIS (`firtoz/trellis`), polls for completion, uploads .glb to `glb-models` bucket. Returns `{ success: true, glb_path }` in response.
- `render-sprites` — DEPRECATED (kept for reference). Use client-side `src/lib/renderSprites.ts` instead.

### RLS Policies Added (migration: `20240103000000_client_sprite_upload_policies.sql`)
- Storage: authenticated users can INSERT/UPDATE in `sprites` bucket
- Table: designers can INSERT/UPDATE `furniture_sprites` for variants belonging to their own items

### CatalogPanel Polling
`CatalogPanel.tsx` has a 5-second polling interval that reloads variants for items with `image_status === 'processing'` or `render_status === 'processing'`. This can conflict with concurrent Supabase operations — avoid calling `loadVariantsForItem` from async callbacks that may overlap with polling.

## Phase 4 Completion Notes
Full isometric canvas with furniture placement, drag, rotation, and variant switching.

### Canvas Store (`src/stores/useCanvasStore.ts`)
- Full CRUD for `placed_furniture` table: load, place, move, rotate, remove, variant switch
- Optimistic local updates with background DB writes for move/rotate/switchVariant
- `placeItem` reads price from Catalog Store for `price_at_placement`
- `savePlacedFurniture()` batch-updates all positions/directions sequentially (avoids concurrency)

### IsometricCanvas (`src/components/editor/IsometricCanvas.tsx`)
- Three PixiJS Container layers: `roomLayer` (walls/floor/fixtures) + `furnitureLayer` (sprites) + `shapeLayer` (edit handles)
- Furniture sprites loaded via `Assets.load()` with texture caching (`textureCache` Map)
- Sprite sizing: `scale = (maxDimCm / 100) * T / 512` where 512 is sprite render size
- Sprite anchor: `(0.5, 0.85)` — bottom-center so furniture sits on floor
- Depth sorting: items sorted by `(u + v)` in rotated space (back-to-front)
- Selection: teal ellipse drawn under selected item, pointerdown on sprite selects + starts drag
- Drag: pointermove updates room coords via `screenToRoom` + `unrotatePoint`, clamped to polygon bounds via `nearestPointOnPolygon`
- Placement mode: ghost sprite at 50% alpha follows cursor, click places item
- Keyboard: Escape cancels placement, Delete/Backspace removes selected item
- ResizeObserver for canvas resize
- Store subscription triggers full redraw on any canvas state change

### Room Rotation
- `rotateVertices()` / `rotatePoint()` / `unrotatePoint()` in `src/lib/roomGeometry.ts` handle all rotation transforms
- `apparentDirection()` combines item direction + room rotation for correct sprite selection
- `RotationControls.tsx` — floating frosted-glass bar with NW/NE/SE/SW buttons

### Polygon Room Shapes
- Rooms support arbitrary polygon shapes (N vertices, CCW winding) stored in `room.geometry.vertices`
- `src/lib/roomGeometry.ts` — centralized polygon math (getVertices, pointInPolygon, nearestPointOnPolygon, rotateVertices, isWallVisible, etc.)
- Wall visibility: outward normal dot camera direction > 0. Visible walls sorted by midpoint depth (back-to-front)
- Furniture placement: `pointInPolygon` test rejects outside polygon, `nearestPointOnPolygon` clamps drag
- Fixtures use `wall_index` (segment index) instead of `PhysicalWall` enum. Legacy data migrated via `migrateFixtureWallIndex()`
- Shape edit mode: vertex handles (drag, 10cm snap), midpoint handles (click to add vertex), Delete to remove (min 4)
- RightPanel: "Edit Shape" toggle, vertex count, "Reset to Rectangle", read-only dims when custom vertices exist
- Canvas store: `shapeEditMode`, `selectedVertexIndex` state + actions

### RightPanel (`src/components/editor/RightPanel.tsx`)
- Context switching: selected furniture → `FurnitureProperties` | selected room → `RoomProperties` | nothing → empty state
- `FurnitureProperties`: item name, category, variant swatches (32px with images), price, dimensions, direction, source link, rotate + remove buttons
- Variant swatches call `canvasStore.switchVariant()` for instant color switching

### CatalogPanel Changes
- "Place on Canvas" button in expanded item section (prefers variant with completed sprites)
- Triggers `canvasStore.setPlacementMode(true, itemId, variantId)`

### EditorPage Wiring
- Loads placed furniture on `selectedRoomId` change, preloads variants + sprites
- `handleSave` also calls `canvasStore.savePlacedFurniture()`
- Placement mode badge in header ("Click on canvas to place — Esc to cancel")
- Canvas cursor: `crosshair` in placement mode, `grabbing` when dragging

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- One Zustand store per file in src/stores/ (6 stores — see state-map.md)
- Supabase client in src/lib/supabase.ts
- Use Tailwind utility classes + CSS variables from design.md
- Use shadcn/ui components as the base UI library
- Use Lucide React for all icons

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint + Prettier

## Key Rules
1. **Read the relevant doc before implementing any feature.** Each doc owns a specific domain — check the scope table at the top of each file.
2. **Never duplicate state across Zustand stores.** Catalog Store is the single source of truth for all product data. Other stores reference by ID only. See state-map.md.
3. **Cost summary is always computed live, never stored.** Derive from placed furniture variant prices (Catalog Store) + manual costs (Project Store).
4. **Furniture uses a parent + variants model.** Parent item holds shared details. Each color variant has its own image, price, link, .glb, and sprites. See schema.md.
5. **Image approval is a hard gate.** Designer must approve background-removed images before TRELLIS runs. See integration-contracts.md.
6. **Designer uploads images manually.** The scraper only extracts text data (name, description, dimensions). It does NOT download product images.
7. **Three.js sprite rendering runs client-side.** After TRELLIS generates a .glb, the browser renders 4 isometric sprites using Three.js (src/lib/renderSprites.ts) and uploads them to Supabase Storage. PixiJS handles all canvas rendering. Three.js is used server-side only for room perspective previews.

## API Keys Required
- **Supabase:** Project URL + anon key + service role key (from Supabase dashboard)
- **Replicate:** API token (from replicate.com — for TRELLIS model)

## Database
- All tables defined in docs/schema.md
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Designers see own drafts + approved items; admins see everything
